# TimeAndResonance
Generative Interactive Installation Project

Music doesnâ€™t exist now. It only exists in the future and the past; musical notation describes what the musician plays in the future. Once a musician plays phrases, melodies, or chords, they only exist in our memories (past). This installation attempts to embody what we recognises as a music and its relationship with the time in a form of an interactive installation, by visualising future and past of sounds.
