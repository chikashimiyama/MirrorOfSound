# TimeAndResonance
Generative Interactive Installation Project

music doesnâ€™t exist now. It only exists in the future and the past; The musical notation describes what the musician plays in the future. Once it is played, the played phrases, melodies, or chords by the musician only exist in our memories (past). This installation attempts to embody what we recognises as a music in a form of an interactive installation, by visualising future and past of sounds.
